            <h2 id="h" >About Me</h2>
             <div id="h2">
        <p id="about" >I am 20 years old, and currently studying applied information technology at Al-Aqsa University. I am interested in learning to develop web front-ends and solve programming problems. Having a creative background helped me to be sympathetic, realistic, open, confident, and frank in personal interactions.
            Because I can convey my ideas through illustrations on a draft and then apply them with HTML code to become a front end with a beautiful design and touches of css language
            And the application of interaction within the web page through the JavaScript language, I am keen to work on self-development as there is room to constantly expand my skills.
            nice to meet you !</p>
